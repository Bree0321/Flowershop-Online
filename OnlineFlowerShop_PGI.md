#  Project General Information

## A. Problem Statement 
Many online flower shops struggle to provide a seamless customer experience, leading to low customer satisfaction and limited sales. Common challenges include limited customization options, inaccurate product representation, delivery challenges, lack of personal touch, and high return rates. These issues have contributed to the overall dissatisfaction of online flower shop customers, as evidenced by According to a 2023 survey conducted by Consumer Reports Survey, only 57% of online flower shop customers were satisfied with their overall experience. The survey highlighted issues such as inaccurate product descriptions, late deliveries, and poor customer service as major contributors to dissatisfaction. Therefore, there is a clear need for an online flower shop that can address these challenges and provide a superior customer experience, focusing on factors such as product accuracy, timely delivery, and exceptional customer service.

## B. Project Description
The goal of this project is to establish a leading online flower shop that offers a diverse selection of high-quality floral arrangements, exceptional customer service, and a convenient online shopping experience. By focusing on reliable delivery, a user-friendly platform, and a wide range of options, we aim to cater to both individual customers and businesses seeking floral arrangements for various occasions.

## C. Project Objectives
In creating the Flower Shop Online to help manage and maintain the great features of it, we first develop the Admin and User Dashboard for a separate use of its users. Admin dashboard feature aims to access the shop's products which is to remove, add, and update the items. User dashboard is where the customers login their accounts where they have the access to the shop's items,  whether to buy the item (add to cart) or save them into a wishlist page. Additionally, customers can leave reviews, check their placed orders, and use a search engine to find products. The Admin dashboard also provides essential tools to manage inventory efficiently by allowing the removal, addition, and updating of products. 
Key Features:

1. Admin Dashboard
2. User Dashboard
3. Shopping Cart
4. WishList
5. Customer Reviews
6. Placed Orders
7. Search engine for the products
8. Remove, Add, Update Products in Admin Dashboard

## D. Business Benefits
1. Convenience: Customers can order flowers from the comfort of their own home or office, at any time of day.
2. Accessibility: Online flower shops are accessible to customers in remote areas or with limited mobility.
3. Competitive Prices: Online flower shops can often offer more competitive prices due to lower overhead costs.
4. Cost Savings: Operating an online flower shop can be more cost-effective than a traditional brick-and-mortar shop, as there are lower overhead costs such as rent and utilities.
5. Flexibility: Online flower shops can operate 24/7 and offer flexible delivery options.
6. Scalability: Online flower shops can easily scale their operations to meet increased demand without the need for physical expansion.

## E. Project Deliverables
  1. Requirements:
     - We focus on choosing a legitimate online flower shop and cover various essential needs. To begin, we will do extensive research and analysis, focusing on current market trends, client preferences, and what other flower shops are offering. This will assist us in determining what distinguishes our platform and keeps it competitive. Finding genuine flower businesses to collaborate with will be an important component of our data collection process. This guarantees that we get high-quality items from trustworthy companies, which is critical for establishing assurance with our customers. In addition, we will create user experiences that depict the average customer's experience across the website from browsing to purchasing to ensure that the site is user friendly and accessible. Along with that, we will create user cases that outline certain features and functionalities, allowing us to address possible difficulties ahead of time. Finally, we'll create a data dictionary that will serve as a guide for the entire team, identifying essential terminology and data pieces to ensure that everything remains structured and consistent throughout the project. By carefully planning each step, we hope to create a functioning and user-friendly flower shop that fits both customer demands and company objectives.
